# Fake_News_Emotions_Detection

### Motivation
Social platforms are a primary source of news, but also facilitate misinformation. Anger and other negative emotions help misinformation spread. Traditional fact-checking is no longer enough, so automated detection is needed. This must address emotional manipulation and the evolving nature of misinformation. 
In this paper, we fine-tune three transformer models to improve emotion detection and fake news identification. Additionally, a Gradient Boosting model is trained as a baseline for fake news detection. Our approach focuses on incorporating emotional features into fake news detection, as emotional cues, particularly low arousal levels, appear to be important indicators of misinformation. Our results show that RoBERTa performs well in detecting valence, while BERT achieves strong outcomes in fake news detection, surpassing the Gradient Boosting model in all key metrics.
